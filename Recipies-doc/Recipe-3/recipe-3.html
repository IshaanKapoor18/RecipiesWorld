                Variations:
            </h2>
            <p>
                When paneer tikka is served with a sauce, it is called paneer
                 tikka masala. It is also served as with a wrap, paneer
                  tikka roll, where the paneer tikka is wrapped into an 
                  Indian bread and served. A variant of paneer tikka is also
                   made as a kebab.
<br><br>
Over the years, there have been several variations,
such as Kashmiri paneer tikka, where the paneer is stuffed 
with chopped almonds and grilled, a variety of Chinese food,
 paneer tikka masala chow mein, and dosa stuffed with paneer tikka.

            </h2>
<p>
    International fast food chains in India have also incorporated paneer 
tikka into their menus, such as Pizza Hut and Domino's which offer a paneer
 tikka topping on their pizzas, whereas Subway offers a paneer
  tikka sandwich and McDonald's has a paneer tikka
   wrap on its menu. ITC's Bingo brand of potato chips
    has experimented with a paneer tikka flavour of chips.
     Prior to that, in 2003, Nestle's Maggi experimented with a
      ready to cook variety of paneer tikka. Other companies 
      also offer spice mixes and ready-to-eat variants of paneer tikka.

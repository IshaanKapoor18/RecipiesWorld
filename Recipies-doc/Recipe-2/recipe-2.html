                The dish originated as a fast lunchtime dish for textile mill workers in Mumbai.
                 Pav bhaji was later served at restaurants throughout the city.
                  Pav bhaji is now offered at outlets from simple hand carts to formal

                   Pav bhaji is a spiced mixture of mashed
                    vegetables in a thick gravy served with
                     bread. Vegetables in the curry may commonly
                      include potatoes, onions, carrots, chillies,
                       peas, bell peppers and tomatoes. Street sellers 
                       usually cook the curry on a flat griddle (tava) 
                       and serve the dish hot. A soft white bread roll 
                       is the usual accompaniment to the curry, but this

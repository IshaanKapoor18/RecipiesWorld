                                    bread. Vegetables in the curry may commonly
                                    include potatoes, onions, carrots, chillies,
                                    peas, bell peppers and tomatoes. Street sellers 
                                    usually cook the curry on a flat griddle (tava) 
                                    and serve the dish hot. A soft white bread roll 
                                    is the usual accompaniment to the curry, but this
                                        does not preclude the use of other bread varieties
                                        such as chapati, roti or brown bread.
                                    The dish originated as a fast lunchtime dish for textile mill workers in Mumbai.
                                    Pav bhaji was later served at restaurants throughout the city.
                                     Pav bhaji is now offered at outlets from simple hand carts to formal
                                      restaurants in India and abroad.
